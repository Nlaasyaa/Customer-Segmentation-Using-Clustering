Project Overview
This project focuses on clustering customers based on their credit card usage patterns, with the goal of identifying optimal marketing strategies tailored to different customer segments. By utilizing unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the project aims to help banks maximize revenue through targeted campaigns. The primary objective is to segment customers and develop personalized marketing strategies to promote specific products and services to the most relevant customer groups.

Key Questions Addressed
How can customers be segmented to identify the best marketing strategies that attract and retain customers while promoting specific products?
After segmentation, which customer groups should be targeted to increase revenue?
Once prospective customers are identified, what marketing strategies should be implemented to enhance engagement and drive revenue growth?
Project Steps
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to gain insights and understand the relationships between various features.
Treating Missing Values: Handle any missing data to ensure a clean and accurate dataset.
Data Scaling: Normalize the data to prepare it for clustering.
Outlier Dropping: Identify and remove outliers to improve clustering accuracy.
Dropping the PURCHASES Column: Eliminate the "PURCHASES" column to focus on other important variables.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce dimensionality while retaining significant variance to improve clustering performance.
K-Means Clustering: Apply K-Means Clustering to group customers into distinct segments based on their credit card usage.
Customer Segmentation: Identify and interpret customer segments to determine which groups are best suited for targeted marketing efforts.
Outcome
The customer segments derived from this analysis will help identify key customer groups that should be targeted with specific marketing campaigns, with the ultimate goal of increasing customer engagement and driving revenue growth for the bank.
